# WatchTogether

Website to watch YouTube videos together.

There are bugs connected with syncing videos when time is changed, room members' list isn't done normally etc.

Used technologies:
- dotnet5, C# 9
- aspnet core (MVC)
- signalR
- bootstrap
- JS for interacting with signalR and YouTube videoplayer API
